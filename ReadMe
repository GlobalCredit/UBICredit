Congrats!
If you have been invited, you have been selected to make the first sustainable global currency that 
pays tax credits from use to everyone that is using the currency.
The idea is pretty straight forward, i will make a telegram so we can communicate and share ideas.
If this project is completed correctly it will replace global currencies and possibly bitcoin.
Your experience and freedom to be creative will guide this project to success.

Universal Basic Income Credit:
(POU)=(ProofOfUse)
[First Cryptocurrency To Abide By ProofOfUse Protocol]


UBI Credit is the first ever blockchain reward global tax currency using the pou protocol.
UBI Total Supply: $29,288,096,877 UBI

Essentially the first wallet will hold 25 Billion UBI - 10Billion UBI which will be shared 
with global leaders across the world equally to support adoption.
A total of 6,288,096,877UBI(FounderCredits)(Wallet Requires balance & transactions must be made weekly)
will be rewarded to the initial users who transact with the coin during the launch months and the reward
will be payed as example 1 this will incentivize people to transact their coins because only those who use
the coin will be rewarded. 1% Tax for each transaction will pooled during the first 4 months and will be shared
on week 17 after the Founder Rewards have been paid fully. Every week after the first tax is paid, 1% tax will be
consistently collected on each transaction and will be paid equally to each 
active user(Users who run nodes will receive double/more UBI Tax Credit then those who just transact with UBI),
those who do not transact for the week will not receive the UBI tax credit and will be left out of the tax pool.

Example 1:
Month 1:
week 1: 5 Billion UBI [Rewards dropped in active wallets at the end of the week]
week 2: 1 Billion UBI 
week 3: 200 Million UBI[First Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 5 each week]
week 4: 40 Million UBI
=6.24Billion
Month 2:
week 1: $36 Million UBI [Rewards dropped in active wallets at the end of the week]
week 2: $9 Million UBI
week 3: $2.25 Million UBI      [Second Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 4 each week]
week 4: $562,500 UBI
=47,812,500UBI
Month 3:
week 1: $187,500 UBI [Rewards dropped in active wallets at the end of the week]
week 2: $62,600 UBI
week 3: $20,833 UBI      [Third Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 3 each week]
week 4: $6,944 UBI
= $277,877UBI
Month 4:
week 1: $3472 UBI
week 2: $1736 UBI
week 3: $868 UBI      [Second Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 2 each week]
week 4: $434 UBI
=$6510UBI
---------------------------
Total UBI = $29,288,096,877 UBI

The only cost to transact with another wallet holder is 1% Tax which is returned as a 'Credit' on week 17 and will continue being paid to those who continue to transact with UBI every week after. 
Those who run nodes for UBI will receive double the tax rewards compared to those who only use UBI.

I'm looking for those experienced in blockchain that can make this idea come to light, everyone is welcome to join.

Essentially everyone including governments will receive the tax credit & if government bodies host nodes they will receive double the credit as compared to someone who just transacts with UBI.


What is proof of use?
Essentially the protocol behind proof of use is the ability for wallet holders to be rewarded 
for transferring UBI Credits to each other continuously, as each transfer takes place a 1% transaction
tax fee is charged and collected in a pool wallet to later be distributed as a credit to all active ‘using’
wallets. Those who ‘DO NOT USE’ the coin will be denied the Universal Basic Income Tax Credit weekly reward.
This protocol is to ensure bartering is continuous in the economy and those who do not contribute to the economy
are not reward for failing to ‘use’.
