Universal Basic Income Credit:

UBI Credit is the first ever block reward global tax currency.
UBI Total Supply: $29,288,096,877 UBI
Essentially the first wallet will hold 25 Billion UBI & 10Billion UBI will be shared with global leaders across the world equally. A total of 6,288,096,877 UBI(Wallet Requires balance & transactions must be made weekly) will be rewarded to the initial users who transact with the coin during the launch months and the reward will be payed as example 1 this will incentivize people to transact their coins because only those who use the coin will be rewarded. 1% Tax for each transaction will pooled during the first 4 months and will be shared 1 week after the Block Rewards have been paid fully. Every week after the first tax is paid, 1% tax will be consistently collected on each transaction and will be paid equally to each active user(Users who run nodes will receive double/more UBI Tax Credit then those who just transact with UBI), those who do not transact for the week will not receive the UBI tax credit and will be left out in the tax pool.

Example 1:
Month 1:
week 1: 5 Billion UBI [Rewards dropped in active wallets at the end of the week]
week 2: 1 Billion UBI 
week 3: 200 Million UBI[First Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 5 each week]
week 4: 40 Million UBI
=6.24Billion
Month 2:
week 1: $36 Million UBI [Rewards dropped in active wallets at the end of the week]
week 2: $9 Million UBI
week 3: $2.25 Million UBI      [Second Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 4 each week]
week 4: $562,500 UBI
=47,812,500UBI
Month 3:
week 1: $187,500 UBI [Rewards dropped in active wallets at the end of the week]
week 2: $62,600 UBI
week 3: $20,833 UBI      [Third Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 3 each week]
week 4: $6,944 UBI
= $277,877UBI
Month 4:
week 1: $3472 UBI
week 2: $1736 UBI
week 3: $868 UBI      [Second Month] [Deflation Reward is divided by 2 each week]
week 4: $434 UBI
=$6510UBI
---------------------------
Total UBI = $29,288,096,877 UBI

The only cost to transact with another wallet holder is 1% Tax which is returned as a Credit on the 5th Month and will continue being paid to those who continue to transact with UBI. 
Those who run nodes for UBI will receive double the tax rewards compared to those who only use UBI.

I'm looking for those experienced in blockchain that can make this idea come to light, everyone is welcome to join.

Essentially everyone including governments will receive the tax credit & if government bodies host nodes they will receive double the credit as compared to someone who just transacts with UBI.
